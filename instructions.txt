If you want to test my voting dapp.
this is the address: https://dao-eight.vercel.app/

Here is my code for the frontend: https://github.com/marcplatvoet/dao

Install Metamask (if you don't have that yet)
And select the Kovan test network. this is exacly like the Binance smart chain, but tokens cost anything.

Add this token to your account: 0xB9De1Fe069103Ab76403da6179fA2cc12BDe8F64

Send me your public key or account key, so I can send you some tokens.

my email is marc.platvoet@gmail.com

After this your vote counts with the amount of tokens you have in your wallet.
